## Data Structure: discuss about the organization of the data. EX: Array List, BST, Heap, LinkedList

## Abstract Data Type: should be able to be done without defining its implementation. EX: Priority Queue, Stack

Since we can use Stack which implemented by Linked List. We don't know how does the stack's implementation. However, we can use some methods of stack.


|    |Data Structure|Abstract Data Type|
|-------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
|Array List|Yes|No|
|List|No|Yes|

Array List is similar to the array that it is organizing the data carefully such the first slot of the array should point to an object. However,
we do not define the implementation of the list. Instead, we will think of what list should such as, adding an element, removing an element, knowing th size
of the list etc... 

`Abstract Data Type means we do not know its implementation but we still use it`
