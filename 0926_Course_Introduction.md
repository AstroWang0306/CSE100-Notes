## Data Structure: 
1. discuss about the organization of the data. 
2. Must implement `ALL` functions
3. Data Structures `IMPLEMENT` ADTs
4. EX: Array List, BST, Heap, LinkedList

## Abstract Data Type: 
1. determine what functions or methods SHOULD exists
2. NO omplementation details. 
3. Thinking of its signature, parameters, types, name of the method
4. EX: Priority Queue(FIFO), Stack(LIFO), Priority Queue(Highest-Priority-In-First-Out) 

Since we can use Stack which implemented by Linked List. We don't know how does the stack's implementation. However, we can use some methods of stack.


|    |Data Structure|Abstract Data Type|
|-------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
|Array List|Yes|No|
|List|No|Yes|

Array List is similar to the array that it is organizing the data carefully such the first slot of the array should point to an object. However,
we do not define the implementation of the list. Instead, we will think of what list should such as, adding an element, removing an element, knowing th size
of the list etc... 

`Abstract Data Type means we do not know its implementation but we still use it`

**Is a Tree a Data Structure or ADT?**   

**It's ADT(still debateble)**

***Since in higher trees, we do not have to know the relationships between two nodes or children. Instead, we just determine the signature, parameters or the functions.***
